## Midnight

- Settings from previous versions, will all be overwritten upon Pre-Patch.

## Unit Frames
- Player.
- Target.
- Target of Target.
- Pet.
- Focus.
- Focus Target.
- Boss.

## Libraries
- [oUF Framework](https://github.com/oUF-wow/oUF): This entire AddOn is based on the oUF Framework, without their work, this would be a lot more difficult.
- [Ace3](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ace3): Database & Configuration Windows are all handled by Ace3 & Ace3 GUI.
- [LibDeflate](https://github.com/SafeteeWoW/LibDeflate.git): Handles importing/exporting of profiles.
- [LibDualSpec](https://github.com/AdiAddons/LibDualSpec-1.0.git): Handles specialization profiles.
- [LibSharedMedia](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/libsharedmedia-3-0): Handles all additional media for the AddOn.

All of these libraries contribute to the success of Unhalted Unit Frames & are highly appreciated by myself.

## About the Project
This is a passion project & this has to be maintained as much as possible in order for the longevity of the AddOn. It is solo-developed, but some very kind people from the community have already started contributing.

[Pull Requests](https://github.com/DaleHuntGB/UnhaltedUnitFrames/pulls) are welcome, but I ask that you maintain the structure & layout of my code. Additionally, not all Pull Requests made will be accepted. Anything added is another thing to maintain.

If you find [Issues](https://github.com/DaleHuntGB/UnhaltedUnitFrames/issues), please raise them appropriately and provide as much context as possible. If you have error codes, they help tremendously.

## Future Plans
Before you ask, Party/Raid Frames will be something I work on in the future but this is very low down on my list. There are many great AddOns out there - even in Midnight - that will be able to match the aesthetic of my Unit Frames.

Other than that, I am open to suggestions, provided they are detailed & constructive.
